# 📚 Book Data Ingestion Pipeline

This project automates the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for collecting book metadata and user reviews from Goodreads. It scrapes, cleans, and loads the data into a PostgreSQL database, making it ready for further analysis or visualization.

## 🚀 What It Does

* Extracts book details and user reviews from Goodreads
* Transforms messy data into clean, structured formats
* Loads processed data into a PostgreSQL database
* Built with a modular architecture for flexibility and scalability

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* Python
* BeautifulSoup
* pandas
* SQLAlchemy
* PostgreSQL
* Airflow (optional, for scheduling)

## 📊 Ready for Analysis With

Once the data is loaded, you can use popular tools to analyze or visualize it:

* **Jupyter Notebooks / pandas** for exploratory analysis
* **Power BI / Tableau** for dashboards and reporting
* **Plotly / Seaborn / Matplotlib** for visualizations
* **scikit-learn / NLP libraries** for building recommendation engines or sentiment analysis
